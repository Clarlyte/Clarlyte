# Project Name: Efficient Underwriting Process

## Overview
This project aims to streamline and enhance the underwriting process at <Company Name> through the use of advanced text extraction, preprocessing, and named entity recognition (NER) techniques.

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Text Extraction
- **Tool:** Tesseract OCR
- **Description:** Tesseract is a widely-used OCR engine known for its accuracy in recognizing printed text. It also supports handwritten text, especially when the handwriting is clear and well-formed. Tesseract can be fine-tuned on custom datasets to improve performance for specific handwriting styles.

### Pre-processing
- **Tool:** OpenCV
- **Description:** OpenCV is chosen for preprocessing handwritten documents for OCR with Tesseract due to its versatility and extensive feature set. It offers a wide range of image processing and computer vision functions that can enhance the quality of scanned handwritten documents, making them more suitable for OCR with Tesseract.

### Named Entity Recognition
- **Tool:** spaCy
- **Description:** For named entity recognition (NER) and extracting specific entities like names, birthdays, and ID numbers from scanned documents, spaCy is the preferred choice. It delivers exceptional performance, efficiency, and accuracy, particularly with pre-trained NER models such as "en_core_web_sm". spaCy's user-friendly API and comprehensive documentation further enhance its appeal, making it a streamlined and intuitive option for building NLP pipelines. 

## Benefits
- Improved efficiency in the underwriting process.
- Enhanced accuracy in extracting relevant information from scanned documents.
- Reduction in manual effort and errors.

## How to Use
- Detailed instructions on how to integrate and utilize the tools in this project will be provided in the documentation.
